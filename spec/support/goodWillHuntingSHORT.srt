
1
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,079
Mod f x square dx.

2
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:45,004
So please finish Percival
by next time.

3
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:49,046
I know many of you had this as
undergraduates, but it won't hurt to brush up.

4
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:55,007
Thank you, Steven.

5
00:03:56,517 --> 00:04:01,309
I also put an advanced Fourier system
on the main hallway chalkboard.

6
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,107
And I'm hoping that one of you might
prove it by the end of the semester.

7
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:06,983
Now, the person to do so
will not only be in my good graces...

8
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,359
but also go on to fame and fortune...

9
00:04:10,487 --> 00:04:13,239
by having their accomplishment
recorded and their name printed...

10
00:04:13,365 --> 00:04:16,282
in the auspicious M.I.T. Tech.

11
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:20,276
Former winners include Nobel laureates,
Field's medal winners...

12
00:04:20,412 --> 00:04:25,038
renowned astrophysicists
and lowly M.I.T. Professors.

13
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,625
Well, that's all.

14
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:31,044
If you have any questions,
I'm sure that Tom has the answers.

15
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,578
- Hi, Will.
- Kirsten, how you doing?

16
00:05:10,705 --> 00:05:12,993
- I'm all right. How are you?
- Good.

17
00:05:13,124 --> 00:05:15,495
- I didn't get on Cathy last night.
- No?

18
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:16,906
- No.
- Why not?

19
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:19,961
- I don't know. Cathy!
- What?

20
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:23,456
Why didn't you give me none of that nasty
little hoochie-woochie you usually throw at me?

21
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:27,339
Oh, fuck you and your Irish curse,
Chuckie.

22
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:31,336
Like I'd waste my energy spreadin'
my legs for that Tootsie Roll dick?

23
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:34,805
- So go home and give it a tug yourself.
- Tootsie Roll!

24
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,843
Toot-Toots!

25
00:05:36,977 --> 00:05:40,061
She's missin' a tooth, Will.

26
00:05:40,188 --> 00:05:43,189
She's got skin problems.
I don't...

27
00:05:43,316 --> 00:05:45,937
Plus, it's like 5-to-2, Morgan ends
up marryin' her, you know what I mean?

28
00:05:46,068 --> 00:05:49,104
There's only so many times you can bang
your friend's future wife.

29
00:05:49,237 --> 00:05:51,693
It's wrong.
Where you goin'?

30
00:05:51,823 --> 00:05:56,283
- I'm gonna take off.
- Fuck you, you're takin' off. It's like, what, 10:00?

31
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,616
I'm tired.

32
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:02,782
Irish curse?

33
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,786
She don't know.
There ain't no Irish curse.

34
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,058
- Out!
- Stop brushing me back.

35
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:20,349
Stop crowding the plate!
Which one will it be?

36
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:24,601
You're gonna get charged,
you know that.

37
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:28,483
You think I'm afraid of you, you big
fuck? You're crowdin' the fuckin' plate.

38
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:33,239
Hey, uh, Casey's bouncin' up a bar, uh, at
Harvard next week. We should go up there.

39
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:35,443
- What are we gonna do up there?
- I don't know.

40
00:07:35,577 --> 00:07:39,574
We'll fuck up some smart kids.
You'll probably fit right in.

41
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:44,120
Ow! Fuckin' punk!

42
00:07:45,002 --> 00:07:46,959
- Oh, what's up? You still tough?
- Come on!

43
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:50,417
- You want this?
- Ah, come on, come on. That's it.

44
00:07:52,216 --> 00:07:57,210
I'd hold you forever here

45
00:07:57,345 --> 00:08:00,928
In my arms

46
00:08:01,057 --> 00:08:02,634
- Professor Lambeau?
- Yes?

47
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:06,598
I'm in your applied theories class. We're
all up at the math and science building.

48
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:10,512
Come here. It's Saturday!

49
00:08:10,648 --> 00:08:13,139
Unless you want to have a drink
with me tonight.
