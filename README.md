Many English language learners watch movies as entertainment first, and language learning second.  This app aims to make learning new vocabulary easier by showing words in the context of lines in the movie.  

The intended usage is before watching the movie for a user to browse words he or she is interested in, study them in their movie context, and then watch the movie for reinforcement.
